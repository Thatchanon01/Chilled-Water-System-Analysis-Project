This research tackled improving a factory's chilled water system by harnessing the power of fluid mechanics. Focusing on various aspects like pipe size, flow patterns, and pump behavior, the research delved into the system's inner workings. Alongside this, heat transfer within key equipment and chillers was scrutinized for optimization opportunities. Further efficiency gains were sought through software-aided simulations, leading to a redesigned water flow layout. This optimization resulted in a significant boost in pump efficiency and a notable decrease in overall energy usage, showcasing the potential of combining fluid mechanics principles with simulation tools for industrial system improvements.
